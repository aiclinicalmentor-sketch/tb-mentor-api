WHO_TB_handbook_module2_screening_2021,Table 2.1,1,Area to be assessed,Questions,
WHO_TB_handbook_module2_screening_2021,Table 2.1,2,Existing screening and outreach activities that may allow intersectoral collaboration,Which populations are already being screened for TB? Which other health conditions are already being screened for? What links exist among health care services (e.g. integrated TB/HIV services)? Do any of the potential collaborating agencies have experience in screening for TB or caring for vulnerable populations? Is there infrastructure that could be used for TB screening? Where does the funding come from for the other programmes? Are there already known locations and trained human resources that can be involved in TB screening? Are there social support programmes that could collaborate?,
WHO_TB_handbook_module2_screening_2021,Table 2.1,3,Distribution of TB burden and risk factors; size and distribution of gaps in case detection,"What is the current distribution of the estimated TB burden in this setting (as inferred from TB notification and case-finding, prevalence and mortality) and specifically for different subpopulations or risk groups? What is the current gap in case detection, and what are the specific causes of missed or delayed diagnosis for each subpopulation or risk group? Which subpopulations or risk groups have the highest risk that TB will remain undetected? Which subpopulations or risk groups make the greatest contribution to undetected TB? What are the differences in gender with regard to TB burden, TB risks and barriers to care? Which types of TB are most likely not to be detected? (e.g. extrapulmonary TB) What are the main reasons for gaps in case detection? What are the HIV burden and ART coverage?",
WHO_TB_handbook_module2_screening_2021,Table 2.1,4,Current case-detection activities,"What is the level of knowledge about TB among health-care staff and others who provide care? What is the current definition of presumed TB, and to what extent is it applied in practice? Which algorithms and diagnostic tests are used to screen for and diagnose different types of TB? To what extent are mWRDs available, and which individuals are eligible? What is the yield in different settings? Are CXRs available, and what is the level of access in hospitals, community health centres and mobile health units? Are the CXRs of good quality? Is the interpretation of the CXRs of good quality? How are CXRs used for TB screening and diagnosis? What is the availability of CAD or the willingness to introduce it for TB detection? What is the trend in the number of people being tested for TB, by subpopulation? What is the trend in the proportion of people testing positive for TB among those tested, by subpopulation?",
WHO_TB_handbook_module2_screening_2021,Table 2.1,5,Role of different providers,"When do people go to a provider, and what type of provider do they go to? Do people go to public or private providers? What diagnosis and treatment services are offered by different providers (for example, in the public and private sectors; among formal or informal providers such as traditional healers; by health-care or other providers; by community or civil society organizations)? Are services affordable?",
WHO_TB_handbook_module2_screening_2021,Table 2.1,6,TB awareness and health-seeking behaviour,"What barriers prevent access to diagnostic and treatment services for the targeted community? What is the level of knowledge about TB disease and TB care in the targeted community? What is the level of knowledge about TB risk, transmission, exposure and prevention in the targeted community? What are the main reasons for delays in seeking health care in the targeted community? What are the perceptions of members of the targeted groups regarding TB services?",
WHO_TB_handbook_module2_screening_2021,Table 2.1,7,"Risk group size, distribution and special challenges",What are the sizes and geographical distribution of the different TB risk groups? Which specific barriers to accessing care affect the different groups? What are the specific challenges to initiating and adhering to treatment in each group?,
WHO_TB_handbook_module2_screening_2021,Table 2.1,8,Previous and present experience in improving early TB detection,What were the results of any previous effort to improve the patient- initiated pathway to ensure earlier detection of TB? What were the outcomes and lessons learnt from previous systematic screening initiatives in different risk groups?,
WHO_TB_handbook_module2_screening_2021,Table 2.1,9,"Stigmatization, discrimination, coverage, access, catastrophic costs","What are the existing frameworks for protecting human rights, and to what extent are they enforced? What sort of stigmatization or discrimination might people screened for TB and people diagnosed with TB experience, what are the possible consequences, and what can be done to mitigate those risks? Which groups are at particular risk of stigmatization or discrimination and its consequences, and what can be done to mitigate those risks? What is the legal status of migrants screened for TB and/or diagnosed with TB?",
