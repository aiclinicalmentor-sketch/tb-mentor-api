WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025,Table 2.11.,2,Rifampicin,WRDs LPAs Targeted NGS,MGIT may not be reliable for isolates with borderline resistance mutations,MGIT and DNA sequencing of the entire rpoB gene,"Any mutations (excluding silent mutations) observed in the 81bp RRDRa hotspot region of the rpoB gene are known or assumed to be associated with RIF resistance. In a few cases, mutations in the rpoB gene outside the RRDR are associated with RIF resistance, these would require DR-TB treatment. Sequencing should be considered if the suspicion of resistance is high."
WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025,Table 2.11.,3,Isoniazid,Moderate complexity automated NAATs Low-complexity automated NAATs LPAs Targeted NGS,Reliable and reproducible when testing the CC in all media,MGIT,"If specific inhA promoter mutations are detected in the absence of any katG mutations, increasing the dose of INH is likely to be effective. Low- and moderate-complexity NAATs and LPAs for RIF and INH detection are preferred to guide patient selection for the (H)RZE-LFX regimen. RIF resistance should be excluded before starting the Hr -TB regimen and FQ resistance should be excluded as soon as possible. Targeted NGS (for faster results) or phenotypic DST should be considered if the suspicion of resistance is high and the initial rapid test is susceptible."

Most strains without mutations should be classified as susceptible; however, a strain with no mutations detected by NAATs or LPAs may still be resistant. Targeted NGS (for faster results) or phenotypic DST should be considered if the suspicion of resistance is high."
WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025,Table 2.11.,5,Moxifloxacin (CC),Low-complexity automated NAATs LPAs Targeted NGS,"Reliable and reproducible when testing the CC in LJ, 7H10, 7H11 and MGIT media [a]",MGIT,A strain of TB with no mutations detected by LPA or Xpert MTB/XDR may still be resistant. Targeted NGS (for faster results) or phenotypic DST should be used to confirm both the CC and CB concentrations.
WHO_TB_handbook_module3_diagnosis_2025,Table 2.11.,6,Moxifloxacin (CB),Low-complexity automated NAATs LPAs Targeted NGS,CB for 7H10 and MGIT apply to high-dose moxifloxacin (i.e. 800 mg daily),MGIT,"MFX, even at high doses, is unlikely to be effective if resistant at the CB concentration or if certain high-confidence mutations associated with high MICs are detected."

If EMB is used in an MDR/RR-TB treatment regimen, it cannot be counted as an effective drug in that regimen. Phenotypic DST can result in poor reproducibility for specific mutations; hence, testing in combination with phenotypic DST and DNA sequencing is preferred."

If resistance is detected, PZA should not be included; however, if it is used, it should not be counted as an effective agent."

However, testing should be completed if there are plans to use AMK or STR in an individualized DR-TB regimen. A strain with no mutations in the rrs and eis genes detected by genotypic assays may still be resistant to AMK; this should be confirmed with phenotypic DST c .
