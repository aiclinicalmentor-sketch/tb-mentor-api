WHO_TB_handbook_module5_pediatrics_2022,Table A3.1.,1,Specimen,Description of procedure,Age group,Minimum volume for testing ( These values are the minimum recommended amount; larger volumes have higher bacteriological yields ),Optimal collection time,Comments
WHO_TB_handbook_module5_pediatrics_2022,Table A3.1.,2,(Spontaneous) expectorated sputum,Expectoration of sputum without prior saline nebulization,>5 years,3 mL,Early morning,"If child is unable to produce sputum of sufficient quantity and quality, consider sputum induction"
WHO_TB_handbook_module5_pediatrics_2022,Table A3.1.,3,Induced sputum,Expectoration of sputum preceded by hypertonic saline nebulization,Any age,3 mL,Early morning,"If child is unable to expectorate (children aged <5 years), consider nasopharyngeal aspiration"
WHO_TB_handbook_module5_pediatrics_2022,Table A3.1.,4,Gastric aspirate,Nasogastric aspiration of gastric juice containing swallowed sputum,<7 years,5 mL,Early morning before child gets out of bed,"Upon awakening, sitting and standing, peristalsis begins and stomach gradually empties, compromising volume"
WHO_TB_handbook_module5_pediatrics_2022,Table A3.1.,5,Gastric lavage,Nasogastric instillation of solution to “wash off” and recover sputum adhered to stomach wall,<7 years,10 mL,Early morning,Recommended only when 3 mL gastric aspirate cannot be obtained
WHO_TB_handbook_module5_pediatrics_2022,Table A3.1.,6,Nasopharyngeal aspirate,"Nasopharyngeal suctioning of nasopharynx to collect secretions from upper respiratory tract, but may also collect secretions from lower respiratory tract if cough reflex is stimulated",Mostly <7 years,2 mL,"Unknown, but probably higher yield in morning","Bacteriological yield of nasopharyngeal aspirate tends to be similar to or lower than that of induced sputum or gastric aspirate/ lavage, and this may be a good alternative to these more invasive methods of obtaining sputum"
WHO_TB_handbook_module5_pediatrics_2022,Table A3.1.,7,"Stool ( Children with TB swallow sputum containing TB bacilli originating from the lungs, which then pass through the digestive tract, where they can be detected in stool samples. Stool is, therefore, regarded as a respiratory specimen for the diagnosis of TB. )",Sampling of random stool uncontaminated by urine or toilet bowl,Any age,5 g (about 1 tablespoon),Any time,"Xpert (MTB/RIF or Ultra) testing on stool after simple decontamination procedures can have diagnostic yield similar to gastric aspirate and expectorated sputum, while being non-invasive Bacteriological yield of stool for smear and culture is lower than that of sputum and gastric aspirate/ lavage"
WHO_TB_handbook_module5_pediatrics_2022,Table A3.1.,8,Bronchoalveolar lavage,Bronchoscopy,Any age,3 mL,Any time,Bacteriological yield of one bronchoalveolar lavage sample is not superior to that of serial induced sputum or gastric aspirate/lavage
