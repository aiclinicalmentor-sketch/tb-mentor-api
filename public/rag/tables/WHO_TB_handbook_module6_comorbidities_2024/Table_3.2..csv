WHO_TB_handbook_module6_comorbidities_2024,Table 3.2.,2,Algorithm 1: W4SS followed by LF-LAM and mWRD,"All populations, but reduced accuracy in some populations (reduced sensitivity for people who are clinically stable on ART, reduced specificity for people not on ART [ ART- naïve or interrupted treatment])",At every encounter with a healthcare worker or peer supporter,"Anywhere. When access to tools such as CD4 cell count, CXR, or CRP is limited","This algorithm is feasible to implement in all settings: rapid, and low resource and infrastructure requirements"
WHO_TB_handbook_module6_comorbidities_2024,Table 3.2.,3,Algorithm 2: W4SS and CXR followed by LF-LAM and mWRD,For people who are clinically stable on ART or with a higher CD4 cell count,"When resources allow; at baseline investigation and annually thereafter, aligned with viral load testing","Where there is access to CXR. For people who are asymptomatic, access to CD4 cell count is required to determine eligibility for LF-LAM","The inclusion of CXR in this algorithm increases the sensitivity over symptom screening alone, identifying more people with prevalent TB disease"
WHO_TB_handbook_module6_comorbidities_2024,Table 3.2.,4,Algorithm 3: W4SS followed by CRP followed by LF-LAM and mWRD,For people not yet on ART (ART naïve or interrupted treatment) or with CD4 cell count of less than 200,"When HIV is first diagnosed, during initial HIV investigation or when someone has returned after ART interruption",Where there is access to point- ofcare CRP,The inclusion of CRP in this algorithm increases the specificity over symptom screening alone. It can save costs on diagnostic tests and may allow more people without TB disease to initiate TPT immediately
WHO_TB_handbook_module6_comorbidities_2024,Table 3.2.,5,Algorithm 4: LF-LAM and mWRD in facilities where TB prevalence is >10%,For people living with HIV who are medical inpatients or who are seriously ill and require hospitalization,"When people living with HIV present to a health facility in need of hospitalization, with danger signs indicating serious illness",In facilities where TB prevalence is >10% and where there is quick turnaround time for diagnostic test results,"In this population, rapid action is necessary to reduce mortality, therefore a single mWRD test alongside LFLAM can indicate immediate treatment initiation"
WHO_TB_handbook_module6_comorbidities_2024,Table 3.2.,6,Algorithm 5: Clinical diagnosis for people living with HIV who are seriously ill,For people living with HIV who present with any one of the following danger signs: respiratory rate >30 per minute heart rate >120 beats per minute unable to walk unaided temperature >39 °C,When diagnostic tests are not immediately available or initial diagnostic test results are negative and there is a strong possibility of TB,In peripheral health facilities where immediate referral to a higher-level facility is not possible,May prevent the death of people with HIV in situations when expedited bacteriologically confirmed diagnosis of TB is not possible or feasible because of the person’s clinical condition and limited access to TB diagnostic services
