WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 10,2,Contact investigation coverage,"Number of contacts of people with bacteriologically confirmed TB evaluated for TB disease and TB infection of those eligible, expressed as a percentage",Total number of contacts of people with bacteriologically confirmed TB who completed evaluation for TB disease and TB infection during the reporting period,Total number of contacts of people with bacteriologically confirmed TB during the reporting period,Contact investigation identifies people recently exposed to TB with a high risk of developing TB disease. This activity is poorly implemented in many countries and should be improved urgently to achieve the UNHLM targets. It is also one of the first 10 indicators of the WHO End TB strategy. Contacts of people with MDR/RR-TB should be included.
WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 10,3,TPT coverage,"Number of individuals initiated on TPT of those eligible, expressed as a percentage",Total number of individuals eligible for TPT who initiated treatment during the reporting period,Total number of individuals eligible for TPT during the reporting period,"This indicator (also referred to as a TPT initiation indicator) should include all people considered to be at risk and eligible for TPT according to the national policy, including contacts of people with MDR/RR-TB. A time trend analysis of the numerator provides information on the trajectory of TPT scale-up and helps in assessing progress towards UNHLM targets. Disaggregation by people with HIV (newly or currently enrolled for ART), contacts < 5 years and ≥ 5 years allows reporting to WHO for monitoring of UNHLM targets. Disaggregation by TPT regimen (e.g. 3HP, 3HR, 6H, 6Lfx) helps to assess uptake of newer regimens and procurement and supply chain management."
WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 10,4,TPT completion,"Number of individuals who complete TPT of those initiating treatment, expressed as a percentage",Total number of individuals who completed a course of TPT a that was initiated during the reporting period,Total number of individuals who initiated a course of TPT during the reporting period,"This indicator helps to assess the quality of implementation of PMTPT, as the effectiveness of TPT depends on its completion. For comparison of TPT completion indicators with coverage indicators, the period of reporting should cover the time necessary to complete treatment and to collect data. Disaggregation of regimens of ≥ 6 months from those of shorter duration to assess TPT completion in “cohorts” within a practical time window."
