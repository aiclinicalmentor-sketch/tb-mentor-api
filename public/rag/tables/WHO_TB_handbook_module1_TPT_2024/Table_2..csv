WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 2.,2,Test requirements,A valid TST requires proper intradermal administration of 0.1 mL tuberculin-PPD into the volar surface of the forearm. PPD requires a cold chain. Trained staff are required to administer and read skin induration. Must be read within 48–72 h,A valid TBST requires proper intradermal administration of recombinant antigen into the volar surface of the forearm. Requires a cold chain. Trained staff are required to administer and read skin induration. Must be read within 48 –72 h.,"IGRAs are in-vitro blood tests that detect interferon-γ in blood with an ELISA . Requires fresh blood specimens to mix with antigens and controls, to be processed within 8–30 h after collection while white blood cells are still viable Requires efficient sample transport Different blood collection tubes are necessary for different altitudes."
WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 2.,3,Potential inaccuracy,False-positive TSTs can result from contact with nontuberculous mycobacteria or vaccination with BCG. Potential inaccuracies and bias in reading skin induration False negatives in people with immunodeficiency conditions,• Potential inaccuracy and bias in reading skin induration,"Delay in transport of blood specimen Errors in processing blood specimen Wrong interpretation of assay False-negative results likely in people with immunodeficiency conditions, faded immune memory, technicaloperational variation and in children < 2 years"
WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 2.,4,Advantages,Can be performed in the field Significantly fewer resources required than for IGRA No laboratory set-up required More familiar to practitioners in resource-constrained settings,Can be performed in the field No laboratory set-up required No false-positive results due to BCG,"Single visit required to conduct test; however, test result may be communicated on a second visit, when, as for the TST, clinical management decisions are made Results possible within 24 h No booster effect No false-positive results due to BCG For serial and periodic screening of people who might have occupational exposure to TB (such as surveillance programmes for health-care workers), IGRAs offer technical, logistic and possible economic advantages over TSTs. Two-step testing is not required for IGRAs, because IGRA testing does not boost subsequent test results."
WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 2.,5,Challenges,"Training in intradermal injection, reading and interpretation required Second visit by individual or health-care worker required for test reading Recurrent global shortages and stock-outs of quality assured PPD Requires a cold chain Repeat test (two-step testing) for individuals whose immunity may have waned","Training in intradermal injection, reading and interpretation Second visit by individual or health-care worker required for test reading Requires a cold chain","Higher test cost Phlebotomy necessary Sophisticated laboratory equipment and highly skilled laboratory personnel necessary to perform and interpret test results Potential delays in sample transport over long distances to laboratories that offer IGRA testing Processing and results require at least 1 day (often longer), so that the person might have to return to collect results. If the laboratory standard operating procedure requires batching of tests to reduce costs, delays in reporting results may be > 1 week. Blood samples must be processed within 8–30 h of collection while white blood cells are still viable. Errors in collection or transport of blood specimens or in conducting the test can decrease accuracy. Limited data on use of IGRAs to predict who will progress to TB disease"
WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 2.,6,Preferred test,Children < 2 years Settings with poor laboratory infrastructure,• Settings with poor laboratory infrastructure,"People who have received BCG (either as a vaccine or for cancer therapy); less applicable for adults who received BCG as infants due to waning of effect Groups that are unlikely or unable to return for TST reading, such as homeless people and people who use drugs or for reasons such as long distance, job security and other pressing commitments"
