WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 8.,1,TPT regimen,Duration of treatment interruption,Next step
WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 8.,2,"3HR, 4R, 6H, 6Lfx",< 2 weeks,"Resume TPT, and add the number of days of missed doses to the total treatment duration. Do not change the scheduled date of the next follow-up visit, but postpone the last follow-up visit by the number of extra days to compensate for missed doses. For example, if a child on 3HR misses 3 days of treatment, continue TPT for a total of 3 months + 3 days from the date of start."
WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 8.,3,"3HR, 4R, 6H, 6Lfx",≥ 2 weeks,"If treatment interruption occurred after more than 80% of doses in the regimen had been taken, continue and complete the remaining treatment as per the original plan. If less than 80% of doses in the regimen were taken, and the treatment course can still be completed within the expected treatment duration + 33% additional time, continue and complete the remaining treatment as per the original plan. For example, if an adult on 6H had taken only 120 doses by month 6, the remaining 62 doses can be taken in the next 2 months, without exceeding the 239-day limit. If < 80% of doses in the regimen were taken, and the treatment course cannot be completed within the expected time, consider re-starting the full TPT course. A shorter regimen would be preferable."
WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 8.,4,3HP,1 weekly dose missed,"If the missed dose is remembered within the next 2 days, continue to take remaining doses according to the original schedule. If the missed dose is remembered > 2 days later, take the missed dose immediately, and change the schedule for weekly intake to the day the missed dose was taken, until treatment completion. This will avoid 2 weekly doses being taken fewer than 4 days apart."
WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 8.,5,3HP,> 1 weekly dose missed,"If treatment interruption occurred after at least 9 doses were taken within 12 weeks of starting, continue and complete the remaining doses, thus prolonging the total treatment duration to a maximum of 112 days. If ≥ 4 weekly doses are missed, consider re-starting the full TPT course. If an individual has difficulty in adhering to a weekly routine, consider discontinuing 3HP and offering an alternative regimen with daily dosing."
WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 8.,6,1HP,≤ 7 doses missed,"Continue and complete the remaining doses, thus prolonging the total treatment duration to a maximum of 6 weeks (42 days from starting TPT)."
WHO_TB_handbook_module1_TPT_2024,Table 8.,7,1HP,> 7 doses missed,"If > 7 consecutive doses were missed, consider re-starting the complete course of 1HP regimen. If > 7 doses were missed intermittently, continue and complete the remaining doses, thus prolonging the total treatment duration to a maximum of 6 weeks (42 days from starting TPT)."
